  parameters:
    _filter:
      in: query
      name: _filter
      required: false
      description: >-
        This is a family of parameters rather than a fixed-name parameter: any number of response
        object fields can be specified as parameters, with the desired field values as parameter
        values. It defines a filter for the response objects: only objects having the specified
        field values will be included in the response. Nested fields must be referenced by joining
        their names via a period - see the example.
      schema:
        type: object
    _format:
      in: query
      name: _format
      required: false
      description: >-
        Response format type. The HTTP `Accept` header is used as the format if this parameter is
        unspecified. If the `Accept` header is unspecifed too, then `JSON` is used. Keys of
        the elements that do not start with a letter or an underscore are prefixed with an
        underscore for `XML`. Fields of the list type are skipped for `CSV`.
      schema:
        type: string
        enum:
          - JSON
          - XML
          - CSV
    _stripDefault:
      in: query
      name: _stripDefault
      required: false
      description: >-
        Omit fields which have values equal to their default values. Otherwise, such fields will not
        be omitted.
      schema:
        type: boolean
        enum: [true]
    _keepDefault:
      in: query
      name: _keepDefault
      required: false
      description: >-
        Deprecated, use `_stripDefault` instead. If specified works in reverse to _stripDefault.
      schema:
        type: boolean
        enum: [true, false]
    _language:
      in: query
      name: _language
      required: false
      description: >-
        Preferred language for texts in the response body. If unspecified, then `en_US` is used.
      schema:
        type: string
    _local:
      in: query
      name: _local
      required: false
      description: >-
        If `false` or unspecified, the information in the response will be collected from other
        Servers in the System as well. If specified as empty or `true`, then only the Server
        processing the request will provide information.
      schema:
        type: boolean
        enum: [true]
    _ticket:
      in: query
      name: _ticket
      required: false
      description: >-
        One-time authorization ticket previously generated using Login REST API
        obtained from the current Server.
      schema:
        type: string
    _pretty:
      in: query
      name: _pretty
      required: false
      description: >-
        Pretty-format the response body if specified. Applied to JSON only.
      schema:
        type: boolean
        enum: [true]
    _strict:
      in: query
      name: _strict
      required: false
      description: >-
        If `false` or unspecified, the Server will produce available results, ignoring minor
        errors. If specified as empty or `true`, then the request will fail on any error.
      schema:
        type: boolean
    _with:
      in: query
      name: _with
      required: false
      description: >-
        Comma-separated list of field names, which defines a filter for the response objects: only
        those objects will be included in the response which have at least one field from this
        list, and only such fields will be included (fields not on this list will be omitted).
        Nested fields must be referenced by joining their names via a period, for example:
        `_with=id,parameters.name`.
      schema:
        type: string
# This section is required by Swagger codegen CLI.
paths:
  # At least one path is required, but as it is empty the `paths` section in the result Open API
  # JSON file is empty.
